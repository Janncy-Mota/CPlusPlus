The client was The Gaming Room and the type of software that they wanted me to design was a Draw it Or Lose It Game. 

In terms of what I did well when it came to developing this documentation.

I'd say that it was more of the structurization and how I wanted the programming to be laid out along with the servers, operating system, and development that was to be used.

The process of working through the design document was helpful because it laid out what the plan was for the code specifically and helped in making it easier to work through.

If I could choose one part of my work to revise on the documents, it would probably be the expenses that I listed out or the operating systems that I chose because there's just so much diversity.

I interpret the user's needs and implemented them into my software design by examining exactly what it was that they wanted, in this case, The Draw it Or Lose it being what was wanted here.

Also taking the work here, which can be used for collaboration and splitting it to make it easier to go through.

One technique and strategy that I plan on using in the future is laying out the documentation as we did in this course, I found it to be really useful for planning out the rest of the programming along with what components to use.
